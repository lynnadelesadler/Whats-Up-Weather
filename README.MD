# Whats-Up-Weather
## Description
Whats Up Weather uses a third party API from Open Weather to request weather data from cities searched. Users will be able to search for a city and see the current weather in addition to the five day forecast. A users search history is saved in local storage and added to a search history list as a button which can render the search data for that city.
